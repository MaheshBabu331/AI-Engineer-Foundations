 # AI Engineer Foundations

This repository is part of my **100 Days AI Engineer Challenge**.

The purpose of this repository is to strengthen the **core foundations required for AI and Machine Learning engineering** before moving into advanced models and deployment.

## Focus Areas
- Python fundamentals and clean coding practices
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- NumPy for numerical computation
- Pandas for data handling and analysis
- Basic math intuition used in Machine Learning

## Approach
- Code-first learning
- Daily commits
- Concepts are implemented, not just studied
- Regular refactoring for clarity and correctness

## Progress Tracking
Each day’s work is committed with clear messages to track progress throughout the challenge.
