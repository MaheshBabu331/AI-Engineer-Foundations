# AI Engineer Foundations

This repository contains foundational engineering work developed as part of a **100 Days AI Engineer Challenge**.

The repository serves as a structured workspace for building and refining the **core technical skills required for AI and Machine Learning engineering**, with a strong emphasis on correctness, clarity, and engineering discipline.

---

## Scope of Work
- Python fundamentals and clean coding practices
- Writing reusable and testable functions
- Basic Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Numerical computation using NumPy
- Data handling and analysis using Pandas
- Core mathematical concepts relevant to Machine Learning

---

## Repository Organization
Work is organized into **day-wise folders**, where each folder represents focused hands-on implementation completed on a specific day of the challenge.

This structure reflects incremental learning, consistent practice, and continuous improvement over time.

---

## Engineering Principles Followed
- Code-first learning over passive study
- Meaningful version control commits
- Incremental refinement through refactoring
- Focus on understanding system behavior and edge cases
